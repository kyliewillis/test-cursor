# Project Specifications

## Overview
A Python-based expense tracking system for managing shared expenses between multiple individuals, with a focus on generating insights and visual reports.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Documentation-First Development
- All code changes must be preceded by documentation updates
- Documentation updates must be reviewed and approved before code changes
- Documentation should include:
  - Feature description
  - Technical requirements
  - API changes
  - User interface changes
  - Testing requirements
  - Performance considerations

### 2. Code Review Process
- Documentation review must be completed before code review
- Code changes must match approved documentation
- Any deviations from documentation require documentation update approval

### 3. Version Control
- Documentation changes should be committed separately from code changes
- Documentation commits should reference related code changes
- Documentation should be versioned alongside code

## Core Features

### 1. Expense Management
- Add, edit, and delete expenses
- Categorize expenses
- Assign expenses to specific individuals
- Support for shared expenses
- Date tracking for all transactions

### 2. Data Persistence

### 5. Visualizations
- Spending by category (pie chart)
- Spending by person (bar chart)
- Expense distribution analysis
- Monthly trend analysis
- Budget insights and statistics

### 6. Statistics and Insights
- Total spending calculations
- Per-person spending breakdowns
- Category-wise spending analysis
- Monthly spending patterns
- Expense distribution analysis
- Budget insights and metrics

## Technical Requirements
